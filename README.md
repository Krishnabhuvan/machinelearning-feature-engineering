# pandasprofiling

Pandas Profiling (now renamed to YData Profiling) is a Python library that automatically generates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) report from a Pandas DataFrame.

Instead of manually checking each column, missing values, correlations, etc., Pandas Profiling creates a full HTML report in a few lines of code.

📊 Dataset statistics (number of rows, columns, duplicates, missing values, memory usage)

🔎 Variable types (numeric, categorical, boolean, date)

📈 Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quantiles)

📉 Distribution plots for each feature

🔗 Correlations (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, Cramér's V)

⚠️ Alerts (high cardinality, skewed distributions, too many missing values, etc.)

#Standardization?

Standardization (or Z-score normalization) is a data preprocessing technique used to rescale features so they have:

Mean = 0

Standard deviation = 1

It transforms each feature to a standard normal distribution.
